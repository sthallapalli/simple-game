A simple game service using RESTful 


Create a RESTful service using which players can play a simple game described
below.

- The game should have the following rules:

- The player has an infinite amount of coins.

- The player bets 10 coins to play a normal game round.

- In any round (free or normal), the player has a 30% chance of winning back 20 coins.

- In any round (free or normal), the player also has a 10% chance of triggering a free round where
the player does not have to pay for bet. The free round works in the same way as a normal round except
it costs 0 coins. The free round should follow immediately after the normal round.

- The player can both win coins and free round at the same time.

# How to use
